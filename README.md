### Configuration and Setup

If you have already been whitelisted for the DV360 API, proceed to step #3
directly.

    script.
2.  Reach out to your DV360 representative to get whitelisted for accessing the
    DV360 API.
3.  [Open the GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and navigate to
    _APIs & Services > Library_ and enable both the _Display & Video 360 API_
    as well as the _Google Sheets API_.
4.  Create an Apps Script project that is linked to a Google Spreadsheet by
    navigating to _Tools > Script Editor_ within the desired Spreadsheet.
    Alternatively open the script directly from the
    [Apps Script Project Dashboard](https://script.google.com/home/all).
5.  Within the Script Editor, navigate to _Resources > Advanced Google Services_
    and toggle the switch for _Google Sheets API_.
6.  Within the Script Editor, navigate to _Resources > Cloud platform project_
    and link the GCP project created in step #1 using its _project number_. You
    can retrieve the project number ny navigating to the GCP console's _Home_
    and copying the number out of the _Project info_ card.
